### `Description`
The International Space Station Tracker is a web application I developed for fun to plot the location of the ISS while in orbit onto a world map. This project is a work-in-progress, and I aim to also add a feature that allows users to pinpoint a coordinate set on the world map and receive a set of times that the ISS will be visible in the night sky for them. The frontend is built using modular React components with CSS styling, and this application is powered by a number of API such as React-Maps and OpenNotify. This application is deployed using AWS Amplify.
